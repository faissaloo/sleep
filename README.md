sleep
===
A rewrite of the POSIX sleep program in x86 Assembly, it's 98.8% smaller than GNU's implementation (31408 bytes vs 392 bytes). It takes an integer to specify 
time, any non-numeric character will terminate the string.  
Fun fact: I wrote this entirely at an airport while waiting for my flight, such is boredom.
